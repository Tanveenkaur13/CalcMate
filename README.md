# CalcMate
This project is a simple yet functional calculator application built using Python and its built-in Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.  Designed to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication and division—it offers a clean and intuitive layout that mimics the look and feel of a standard calculator.
